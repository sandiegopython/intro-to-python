San Diego PyLadies hosted a workshop at the Geek Girl Tech Conference on
Saturday June 21, 2014.


IPython Notebook Files
----------------------

You can view each of the files online using `nbviewer`_.

* `part-1.ipynb`_: numbers, strings, variables, booleans, "if statements"
* `part-2.ipynb`_: lists and loops
* `part-3.ipynb`_: defining functions and using modules


Giving the talk
---------------

Before giving the talk, IPython Notebook must be installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install 'ipython[notebook]'

How to run an IPython Notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ipython notebook part-1.ipynb

At the workshop we gave the talk like this:

* We opened a Python shell on the projector monitor and an IPython notebook on the laptop monitor
* One person read the notebook and typed into the Python shell
* Another person stood in front of the audience and explained each step
* Questions were answered ad-hoc, occasionally by Googling answers or typing at the terminal
